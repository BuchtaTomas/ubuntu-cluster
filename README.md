This repository is part of my personal home lab — a project that started simply from curiosity and slowly grew into a place where I learn, experiment, and challenge myself. 
I enjoy understanding how things work beneath the surface, so in my free time I build small self‑hosting setups, automate tasks, and explore Linux and DevOps tools hands‑on.
Nothing here is meant to be perfect. In fact, that’s the point.
This environment is where I try new ideas, make mistakes, fix them, and learn something new every time. It’s a space where I can follow my interests at my own pace and turn theory into something real.
So far, I’ve deployed the Linkding application — first in a simple, unsecured setup for testing, and earlier through a Cloudflare Tunnel for secure access. 
I’ve also enabled Prometheus monitoring and brought Grafana online, and I’m gradually shaping the dashboards to reflect the metrics I care about most.
My next step is to integrate the Audiobookshelf hosting application, continuing the journey of building and improving this small ecosystem.
This lab is where I grow as an engineer — one experiment, one deployment, and one lesson at a time.
